The distribution plots in this directory were created using the particle loader.
The two distribution selections are Gaussian and a uniform ellipse that can be mixed and matched
between position and velocity. The following parameters were used:

sigma_x = 0.1mm
sigma_y = 0.1mm
sigma_z = 10mm

perpendicular temperature = 8.62e-5 eV (1K temp)
parallel temperature       = 8.62e-5 eV (1K temp)

number of particles = 10,000

Beam type => uranium_beam = Species(type=Uranium,charge_state=+1,name="Beam species",weight=0)
