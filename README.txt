The code 'Edited_Nick-Valverde.py' is an edited version of Robert Hipple's ORISS codes.
The code simulates the ORISS design 'Design.png'.

Run Instructions:
- Make sure the inputfile and loader03.py code are located in the same directory
 as the code or in your python path. To check path go to terminal and enter
 the command '$pwd'. If using Spyder, you can enter the same command '$pwd' in the interactive terminal.
- The code can then be executed from the terminal by entering '$python Edited_Nick-Valverde'
 or whatever you chose to name it. The program should then begin running.
- A series of files will then be written to the current directory. CGM files can be viewed
 using Gist. For example, when running the file 'Edited_Nick-Valverde.000.cgm' was written to my working directory.
 I then viewed it by entering '$gist Edited_Nick-Valverde.000.cgm' in the terminal. An xquartz window will
 popupâ€“assuming xquartz is installed. The windows can be switched in the xquartz viewer by tying 'f' for forwarding
 or 'b' for backward.

 The code is still being developed and more instructions will be added to further explain it.
